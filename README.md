An interactive aerodynamic visualization tool that seamlessly transforms between speed-space and coefficient-space coordinate systems. Built for analyzing sustained flight performance with smooth, real-time interpolation between fundamentally different axis representations.

## What Are Sustained Speeds?

**Sustained speeds** are the constant velocities achieved during steady-state flight when all accelerations are zero. At these conditions, aerodynamic forces perfectly balance gravity, creating a direct mathematical relationship between flight speed and aerodynamic coefficients.

This tool visualizes that relationship by morphing between two equivalent representations:
- **Speed Space**: Where you see horizontal speed (Vxs) and vertical speed (Vys)
- **Coefficient Space**: Where you see lift coefficient (CL/KL) and drag coefficient (CD/KD)

Every point on the chart represents the same physical flight condition—just viewed through different mathematical lenses.

## Theory: The Physics of Sustained Flight

*Derivation of the sustained flight equations from first principles*

</div>

### Force Balance in Flight

Consider a body in flight with velocity **V** at angle α from horizontal. Four forces act on it:

```
           L (Lift)
           ↑
           |
    D ←----●----> V (velocity)
           |
           ↓
           W (Weight)
```

Summing forces in the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) directions:

```
Fx = m·ax = L·sin(α) - D·cos(α)
Fy = m·ay = m·g - L·cos(α) - D·sin(α)
```

### Aerodynamic Forces

From aerodynamics, lift and drag are:

```
L = ½·CL·ρ·S·V²
D = ½·CD·ρ·S·V²
```

Where:
- **CL, CD** = dimensionless lift and drag coefficients
- **ρ** = air density (kg/m³)
- **S** = reference wing area (m²)
- **V** = total airspeed = √(Vx² + Vy²)

### The Equations of Motion

Since sin(α) = Vy/V and cos(α) = Vx/V, we can derive the equations of motion:

```
dVx/dt = k·V·(CL·Vy - CD·Vx)
dVy/dt = g - k·V·(CL·Vx + CD·Vy)
```

Where **k = ½·ρ·S/m** is the scaling factor.

### Sustained Flight Condition

For **sustained flight**, accelerations are zero by definition. Setting dVx/dt = 0 and dVy/dt = 0:

```
k·Vs·(CL·Vys - CD·Vxs) = 0
k·Vs·(CL·Vxs + CD·Vys) = g
```

Where Vs = √(Vxs² + Vys²) is the sustained total airspeed.

## K-Coefficients: Simplifying the Math

### Definition

To eliminate the scaling factor from our equations, we define **K-coefficients**:

```
KL = CL · k / g = CL · ρ · S / (2·m·g)
KD = CD · k / g = CD · ρ · S / (2·m·g)
```

### The Elegant Result

Substituting into the sustained flight equations gives us two equations with two unknowns:

```
KL·Vys = KD·Vxs                    (eq. 1)
Vs·(KL·Vxs + KD·Vys) = 1          (eq. 2)
```

**The solution is remarkably simple:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  KL = Vxs / Vs³                 │
│  KD = Vys / Vs³                 │
│                                 │
│  Or equivalently:               │
│                                 │
│  KL = Vxs / (Vxs² + Vys²)^1.5  │
│  KD = Vys / (Vxs² + Vys²)^1.5  │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Converting Back to C-Coefficients

To recover the standard dimensionless coefficients:

```
CL = KL · g / k = KL · 2·m·g / (ρ·S)
CD = KD · g / k = KD · 2·m·g / (ρ·S)
```

### Units of K-Coefficients

The K-coefficients have dimensions of **inverse velocity squared**:

| Notation | Units |
|----------|-------|
| s²/m² | seconds squared per meter squared |
| 1/(m/s)² | inverse velocity squared |

This makes physical sense: K-coefficients directly relate aerodynamic forces to speed squared, eliminating the need for separate dynamic pressure and mass calculations.

### Calculating Coefficients from GPS Data

Since K-coefficients depend only on velocity, they can be computed directly from GPS speed measurements during sustained flight:
